# Abhonotik-Movie-Recommendation-System-Content-Based-
The Movie Recommendation System is an application that suggests movies to users based on content-based filtering. This means that the system recommends movies similar to the ones the user has liked or rated highly, based on the attributes of the movies themselves, such as genre, actors, director, release year, plot, and more.
